Have you ever seen some awesome lock screen wallpapers that Windows gives you?
Well as it turns out, you can very easily download them.

![](/media/articles/windows/download-windows-spotlight-images/download-windows-spotlight-images-lockscreen.jpg)

These images in Windows 10 and Windows 11 are called "_spotlight images_". You
can download and reuse the good ones that you want. The best part, it only takes
a few minutes to do.

## Show hidden files and extension

In order to be able to find the uniquely named files are actually the spotlight
wallpapers, you need to be able to see the hidden folders and view file
extensions in Windows. Open Explorer and click the "View" tab. On the right-hand
side, make sure the "File name extensions" and "Hidden items" check boxes are
checked.

Once hidden items are enabled, now navigate to the folder listed below. Where
**_USERNAME_** is the username of the account logged into.

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets

![Browse to this special Window spotlight folder](/media/articles/windows/download-windows-spotlight-images/spotlight-files-home-1024x406.png)

You should see a listing of nearly unreadable files that have no file type
associated with them. That's because Windows tries to hide the spotlight
wallpapers from the user by default. For the most part, the files in this folder
are images but not all of them are the spotlight wallpapers we are looking for.
If you sort all the files by size, it will give you a better idea of which ones
are the wallpapers and which ones are other images (like app icons). More on
this later.

You should see a listing of nearly unreadable files that have no file type
associated with them. That's because Windows tries to hide the spotlight
wallpapers from the user by default. For the most part, the files in this folder
are images but not all of them are the spotlight wallpapers we are looking for.
If you sort all the files by size, it will give you a better idea of which ones
are the wallpapers and which ones are other images (like app icons). More on
this later.

## Find the Windows spotlight images

The files that are large than 100KB are most likely the wallpapers that we are
looking for. So you can take the files from this folder and copy them into the
folder you want to keep you new spotlight wallpapers at. I called mine
"Spotlight Saves".

![Rename each of the spotlight images to include the jpg extension](/media/articles/windows/download-windows-spotlight-images/spotlight-renaming-files-1024x422.png)

Start renaming each of the files and add an image extension to them (usually
_.jpg_). If you can see the file icons, they should start showing the thumbnails
for each of the files you rename.

![You can now see the Windows spotlight images like they are regular image files](/media/articles/windows/download-windows-spotlight-images/spotlight-files-extras-1024x400.png)

Once you start seeing the thumbnails that are obviously not wallpapers (you can
see it at image _13.png_), you can delete the rest of the images. The last of
them will be miscellaneous app icons for windows. Who wants those!? Now, just
rename the images that you want to keep. And get rid of the ones you don't.

## Enjoy all the Windows 10 Spotlight Images!

Every few days, your Windows spotlight images will change. So every few days you
can download the new spotlight images. And easily repeat the steps above to get
the new images. If you are like me, then you can pick the best of the images to
set as wallpapers for your
[double monitor setup](./how-to-setup-dual-monitors-on-pc).

So go snag some super high quality Windows 10 spotlight wallpapers for later.
You never know when you might want to go back to one!
