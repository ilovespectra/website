It is easy and quick, especially if you are running an
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) localhost web server.

One of the best things about running your own localhost XAMPP web server is
being able to do all the testing and projects you want for no charge at all. One
of the things that gets forgot about in a lot of these cases is some basic
security practices, like not using the default password.

![How to change your MySQL root password from the command line](/media/articles/phpmyadmin/change-password/thumbnail_Change-phpMyAdmin-and-MySQL-account-passwords.png)

For almost every XAMPP installation, people tend to keep their default _BLANK_
password. That's not very security conscious of us now is it? The good news is
that you can change the root password (aka admin password) for your localhost
phpMyAdmin/MySQL account in just a few minutes. Here's How!

## First, start your MySQL/Apache server

First open up your XAMPP control panel and verify that Apache and MySQL are
running. You will know they are running by their names being highlighted in
green.

Next, launch the specialized Windows command prompt by clicking the "Shell"
button on the right hand side. This will open a black window titled "XAMPP for
Windows".

## How to change the root password for MySQL

In the command prompt type the following:

```bash
mysqladmin --user=root password "SUPERsecretPASSWORD"
```

<Callout>

Note the double hyphen before the user, these are important. If you do not have
these double hyphens then the command will not work. Think of them as part of
the correct syntax for the command.

</Callout>

This will reset the user named "root" with a new password of
"SUPERsecretPASSWORD" (without the quotes). In order for this command to work
correctly, you must have the double quotation marks.

This command will let you set the password only if you are using the default
_BLANK_ password. If your password has already been set or changed at another
time, you will need to use the following command:

```bash
mysqladmin --user=root --password=OLDpass password "NEWpassword"
```

Where "OLDpass" would be your current password for the "root" user. Again, note
the double hyphen before the "user" and "password".

This password reset can work for any and every MySQL and phpMyAdmin accounts
that exists. You just have to change the username and password in the command.

## Verify the root password change worked!

Now like any good computer nerd, it is always a good idea to make sure the
password was changed successfully. To do this we will run a simple SQL command
in the command prompt using our username and password:

```bash
mysql --user=root --password=SUPERsecretPASSWORD -e "SELECT 1+1"
```

![verify your MySQL password was reset](/media/articles/phpmyadmin/change-password/Change-mysql-Password-in-Xampp-3-1024x372.png)

- If the password change was **successful**, you will see a small ASCII chart
  made that looks like it doing some basic math, like in the picture above.
- If the password change was **unsuccessful**, you will see an error message
  stating "Access denied for user root@localhost" (or whatever your username
  is).

## Enable username/password logins

After you have set a password, or changed your password for the MySQL account,
you should update your login style of phpMyAdmin. It is super easy to do. Browse
over to the phpMyAdmin configuration file, _config.inc.php_.

You can find it inside your phpMyAdmin installation directory. If you are using
XAMPP, then it will be (_C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php_).

After you open the phpMyAdmin config file, you need to enable regular style
logins. Browse the file, or control + F, to find the "auth_type" variable.
(Learn about the
[auth_type here](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/config.html)) It will
likely have a complete line looking like this:

```php
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = "config";
```

Update the value of the "_auth_type_" and set it equal to "_cookie_". By setting
this, you will enable cookie logins for phpMyAdmin. This way you will be able to
login using the phpMyAdmin login form and entering your username and password.
